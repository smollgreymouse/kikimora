# 08D1 execution log

Executor log for `08d1-managed-selected-routes-completion.md` (the authoritative
completion packet). One handoff record per stage, per packet §34. This file is
updated as stages land; packet statuses stay authoritative in the packet itself.

Companion revision: `.github/managed-routing-companion.env` pins `LESHY_REF`.
Lab VMs for vertical stages: `docs/lab-vms.md` (note: guest IPs follow the
workstation Wi-Fi subnet; on 2026-11-05 the lab moved 192.168.1.x -> 192.168.3.x,
ubuntu=.53, win=.54).

## Stage 0 — freeze contracts, baselines and red tests

Stage: 0
Kikimora SHA: 378179d094933abd811e0074d1f8f2e101281ec2
Leshy SHA: 84e6e9ab9bab82e49cdba85c344b30c410e710b9 (fresh clone = packet baseline)
Implemented packet sections: §32 Stage 0 work items 1-6.
Wire capability/version: unchanged (managed_selected_routes_v1).
Persistent schema: unchanged (selected-routes.json schema 1, marker schema 1).

Work landed:

- Recorded both baselines here (above) and pinned `LESHY_REF` in
  `.github/managed-routing-companion.env` (§31.18). The cross-repo CI job that
  consumes this ref lands with the first cross-repo job (§24.1) and reads the
  env file from day one; no moving master is ever referenced.
- CI matrices fail-fast=false: Kikimora `toad.yml` go-unit already had it;
  Leshy `ci.yml` `test` matrix now `fail-fast: false` (§24.2).
- Named test skeletons, explicitly skipped with the owning stage in the skip
  message (§32 Stage 0 item 4):
  - Kikimora `toad/internal/routing/selected_schema2_skeleton_test.go` — schema2
    model/planner skeletons (K11).
  - Kikimora `toad/internal/control/managed_selected_stage_skeletons_test.go` —
    mode-journal crashes (1D/6.2), writer fence (1B), privileged auth (1C),
    core StateDir singleton (1B), production recovery selector (K14),
    observation-sequence race (3B), ServeWithReady barrier (1B).
  - Kikimora `toad/internal/platform/windows/routes/selected_exact_replacement_skeleton_test.go`
    — Windows exact replacement + park identity + effective metric (K15/3A).
  - Leshy: Linux IPv6 event restore skeleton added in
    `tests/linux_route_registry_netns.rs` (L11) as an `#[ignore]`d test.
- Baseline counters recorded (§32 Stage 0 item 5):
  - Kikimora unit soak (`TestSoakTenThousandDuplicateEnsuresStayFlat`): 100
    unique /32 intents converge with exactly 100 kernel mutations; 10,000
    duplicate classifications afterwards produce 0 additional mutations,
    DuplicateHits=10000, registry bounded at 100. Fast path is zero-I/O.
  - Leshy baseline: `cargo test --all-targets --all-features` green on
    windows host (3 suites in tail; full suite exit 0); counters for the
    request-path FIB-dump problem are captured by the L11 netns tests
    (`full_snapshots`/`targeted_reads`) which do not exist yet — the *absence*
    of those counters is itself recorded as the known baseline deficit to be
    closed by L11.
- v1 runtime behavior unchanged: Stage 0 contains no production code changes.

Gates run:

- Kikimora: `go test ./...` green (baseline and after skeletons), `gofmt -l`
  clean, `go vet ./...` clean.
- Leshy: `cargo test --all-targets --all-features` green, `cargo fmt --check`
  clean.

Native OS gates run: windows host (this workstation) for both repos.
Privileged gates run: none (Stage 0 requires none).
Crash failpoints run: none (failpoint seams land in Stage 2/7).
Known skipped gate + reason: cross-repo CI job does not exist yet — its
scaffolding (env-pinned checkout) lands with the first cross-repo job; the
packet allows this because no cross-repo evidence was claimed in Stage 0.
Foreign-row proof: n/a (no behavior change).
No-churn counters: recorded above as baseline.
Next-stage entry criteria satisfied: yes — baseline failures none, test
locations fixed, no behavior change hidden in setup.
